##  Architecture

- Uses **Supabase tables** to fetch:
  - Cabin data (`cabins`)
  - Reservation or guest data (`bookings`, if applicable)
- Same Supabase instance as the [admin dashboard](https://github.com/MehdiBouchachi/the-wild-oasis)  
- Public routes consume only **read-access data** (no dashboard privileges exposed)
